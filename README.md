# 4cylinders

Each Markdown file(md) consist of the animations as .mov files. Click on them to see the video. 
The links to the videos are also available for download in the repository.

1. The file "Animation-4CylindersFinal.nb" contains the code for generating the animation called "Animation of Cylinders.mov".

2. The file "Analysis of 4 cylinders.nb" contains the distance equations and the variable substitution method explained in the report. It also contains the calculation of determinants and the generation of the system of equations that needs to be solved for checking the conjecture - for both the systems M and M*.

3. The file "Mathematics of 4 Cylinders.nb" was made so that i can understand and visualize the system - it also includes the calculation done for determinants before variable substitution - this notebook will take a day to run in my Macbook Pro 2021. Some animations are present (in terms of the generators of the cylinders) which may help the viewer. 

4. "Numerical 4 cylinders.nb" was my attempt at a brute-force distance calculation in 9 variables that failed to give any tabulated result (due to memory overloads). On a much better system it should be able to give us the points in M such that the min.dist function D >= 2. 


All notebooks have been commented to explain the notation followed in each of them.
